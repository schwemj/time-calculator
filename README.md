# time_calculator

This is a time calculator program written in Python3, which adds together two times 
and returns the resulting time of day.

To use it, call and print the add_time() function with a start time and a duration as arguments.
If desired, enter a weekday in string-format as third argument. 

Boundaries:

- Start must be input in 12h format (duration can be entered in total_hours:minutes format)
- Input values must be strings
- No whitespace

Examples for valid input:

start = '12:30'

duration = '30:20'

start = '9:02' (alternatively '09:02')
